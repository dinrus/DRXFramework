/**
    Manages a collection of properties.

    This is a slightly higher-level wrapper for managing PropertiesFile objects.

    It holds two different PropertiesFile objects internally, one for user-specific
    settings (stored in your user directory), and one for settings that are common to
    all users (stored in a folder accessible to all users).

    The class manages the creation of these files on-demand, allowing access via the
    getUserSettings() and getCommonSettings() methods.

    After creating an instance of an ApplicationProperties object, you should first
    of all call setStorageParameters() to tell it the parameters to use to create
    its files.

        the common settings are used as a second-chance place to look. This is done via the
        PropertySet::setFallbackPropertySet() method - by default the common settings are set

        @param returnUserPropsIfReadOnly  if this is true, and the common properties file is
                            read-only (e.g. because the user doesn't have permission to write
                            to shared files), then this will return the user settings instead,
                            (like getUserSettings() would do). This is handy if you'd like to
                            write a value to the common settings, but if that's no possible,
                            then you'd rather write to the user settings than none at all.
                            If returnUserPropsIfReadOnly is false, this method will always return
                            the common settings, even if any changes to them can't be saved.

        or getCommonSettings() is called.
