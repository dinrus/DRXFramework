    After DRXApplicationBase::shutdown() has been called, any objects derived from
    DeletedAtShutdown which are still in existence will be deleted in the reverse
    order to that in which they were created.

    So if you've got a singleton and don't want to have to explicitly delete it, just
    inherit from this and it'll be taken care of.
