/**
    Helper class to update several animators at once, without owning or otherwise extending the
    lifetimes of those animators.

    The intended use case is to register Animators with an updater as opposed to separately calling
    Animator::update() on each of them. Calling update() then will update all registered Animators.
    In case an Animator's underlying implementation is deleted (all Animator objects that were
    strongly referencing it were deleted) it is automatically removed by the AnimatorUpdater.

    If you want to update all your Animators in sync with the display refresh you will probably want
    to use the VBlankAnimatorUpdater.

    The order in which Animator::update() functions are called for registered Animators is not
    specified, as Animators should be implemented in a way where it doesn't matter.

        animatorUpdater.addAnimator (someComponentPtr->getAnimator(),
                                     [&someComponentPtr] { someComponentPtr.reset(); });

        this should be a timestamp supplied by a VBlankAttachment. Consider using the
